# Spring 1: C++ Fundamentals

Welcome to **Spring 1: C++ Fundamentals**! This section covers the foundational concepts of C++ programming. It is divided into multiple topics, each focusing on a key concept. The exercises are designed to help you practice and gradually build your skills.

## Topics Covered:
1. **Basic Syntax and Variables**  
   Learn the structure of a basic C++ program, variable declaration, and basic output with `cout`.

3. **Functions**  
   Explore how to define and use functions in C++, including parameter passing.

## Exercise Levels:
- **Level 1**: Introductory exercises to help you get started with the topic.
- **Level 2**: Intermediate exercises to solidify your understanding.
- **Level 3**: Advanced exercises to challenge you further (if applicable).

### How to Navigate:
- Each **Topic** has its own folder.
- Inside each folder, you’ll find solutions to exercises organized by level of difficulty.
- Use this folder to track your progress and refer back to completed work.

## Purpose:
This repository is a personal record of my progress as I learn C#. It contains my completed exercise solutions and serves as a reference for future projects.

Let’s get started!
