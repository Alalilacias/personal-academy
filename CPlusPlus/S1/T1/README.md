# Topic 1: Basic Syntax and Variables

This topic introduces the basic syntax of C++ and the use of variables. You will learn how to write simple programs, declare variables, and display output using `cout`.

## Objectives:
- Write and run a basic "Hello, World!" program.
- Understand how to declare and initialize variables.
- Practice outputting information using `cout`.

## Exercises:
1. **Level 1: Hello, World!**
   - Write a program to print "Hello, World!" and introduce yourself.

2. **Level 2: Character Profile**
   - Create a character profile using variables like `name`, `health`, `speed`, and `alive`. Output these variables using `cout`.

3. **Level 3: User Input and Validation**
   - Modify the character profile program to take user input for each variable. Include validation for inputs (e.g., ensure health is a positive number).
