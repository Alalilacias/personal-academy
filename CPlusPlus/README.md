# CPlusPlus Learning Repository

This folder contains all code, exercises, and projects related to learning C++. The goal is to build a strong foundation in C++ programming, covering core concepts, language syntax, data structures, and algorithms, with a focus on game development.

## Contents

- **Basics**: Simple programs to understand basic syntax, data types, and operators.
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements, loops, and other control structures.
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code with functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Advanced Topics**: Memory management, pointers, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).
- **Game Development Basics**: Implementing small exercises and projects related to game programming.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC or Clang).
2. Compile a file with:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o filename
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./filename
   ```

## Resources

- C++ official documentation: [cplusplus.com](https://cplusplus.com/)
- C++ reference: [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/)
- Additional tutorials and exercises provided in the repository.

## Progress

Check each folder for organized modules, exercises, and completed projects. Follow the provided documentation and examples to get the most out of each exercise.
